            <p>Also referred to simply as an "HT," a ham radio handheld transceiver packs amazing capabilities -- 
                it is a complete station in your hand. You may think of the term walkie-talkie when you see an HT, but hams rarely use that description. 
                The HT is probably the most common ham radio type in existence, and while compact, 
                it can provide excellent communications in many situations where a larger radio is impractical or unnecessary.

            <p>A mobile station is installed in a vehicle and will have a handheld microphone with a push-to-talk switch on it, 
              rather than a chassis-integrated microphone like the HT. The mobile station chassis is usually a few inches across and a few inches deep, 
              and perhaps two-to-three inches high, give or take. The chassis may be mounted under (or in) a vehicle dashboard, 
              or placed under a seat to be operated with a remote control head or faceplate that is easier to mount. The mobile station will also use an external 
              antenna mounted on the vehicle and connected using coaxial cable.
            </p>

              <p>The term base station means a radio station that is fixed in one place, usually in the home. 
                A mobile station like those described above may be configured with a DC power supply to serve as a base station, 
                and there are larger and more capable radios designed specifically for base station implementation. 
                A base station will use a handheld microphone much like the mobile station, or it may use a desktop mic or boom mic if the operator chooses such substitutions.
