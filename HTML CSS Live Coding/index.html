                    Grace Brewster Hopper (née Murray; December 9, 1906 – January 1, 1992) was an American computer
                    scientist, mathematician, and United States Navy rear admiral.[1] She was a pioneer of computer
                    programming.
                    Hopper was the first to devise the theory of machine-independent programming languages, and used
                    this theory to develop the FLOW-MATIC programming language and COBOL, an early high-level
                    programming language still in use today.
                    She was also one of the first programmers on the Harvard Mark I computer. She is credited with
                    writing the first computer manual,
                    "A Manual of Operation for the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator."

                    Grace Brewster Murray was born in New York City. She was the eldest of three children. Her parents,
                    Walter Fletcher Murray and Mary Campbell Van Horne,
                    were of Scottish and Dutch descent, and attended West End Collegiate Church. Her great-grandfather,
                    Alexander Wilson Russell,
                    an admiral in the US Navy, fought in the Battle of Mobile Bay during the Civil War
                </p>
                <p>
                    Grace was very curious as a child; this was a lifelong trait. At the age of seven, she decided to
                    determine how an alarm clock worked
                    and dismantled seven alarm clocks before her mother realized what she was doing (she was then
                    limited to one clock).[13] Later in life,
                    she was known for keeping a clock that ran backward, she explained, "Humans are allergic to change.
                    They love to say, 'We've always done it this way.'
                    I try to fight that. That's why I have a clock on my wall that runs counterclockwise."[14] For her
                    preparatory school education, she attended the Hartridge School in Plainfield, New Jersey.
                    Grace was initially rejected for early admission to Vassar College at age 16 (because her test
                    scores in Latin were too low),
                    but she was admitted the next year. She graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Vassar in 1928 with a
                    bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics and
                    earned her master's degree at Yale University in 1930.

                    In 1934, Hopper earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale[17] under the direction of Øystein
                    Ore.[15][18] Her dissertation,
                    "New Types of Irreducibility Criteria", was published that same year.[20] She began teaching
                    mathematics at Vassar in 1931,
                    and was promoted to associate professor in 1941

                    Hopper tried to be commissioned in the Navy early in World War II, however she was turned down. At
                    age 34, she was too old to enlist and her weight-to-height ratio was too low.
                    She was also denied on the basis that her job as a mathematician and mathematics professor at Vassar
                    College was valuable to the war effort.
                    During the war in 1943, Hopper obtained a leave of absence from Vassar and was sworn into the United
                    States Navy Reserve; she was one of
                    many women who volunteered to serve in the WAVES

                    In accordance with Navy attrition regulations, Hopper retired from the Naval Reserve with the rank
                    of commander at age 60 at the end of 1966.[32]
                    She was recalled to active duty in August 1967 for a six-month period that turned into an indefinite
                    assignment.
                    She again retired in 1971 but was again asked to return to active duty in 1972. She was promoted to
                    captain in 1973 by Admiral Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr.[33]

                In 1982, Captain Grace Hopper delivered a lecture to the National Security Agency (NSA) 
                workforce titled "Future Possibilities: Data, Hardware, Software, and People".  She emphasized the rapid growth of data & the need
                for advancements in hardware & software to keep pace.
